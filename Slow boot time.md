## Slow boot time

_ Slow boot times can be frustrating! Here are some common causes and potential solutions to help speed things up_

- Too Many Startup Programs: Check which programs are set to launch at startup. You can manage these through the Task Manager (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac).

- Hard Drive Health: If youâ€™re using an HDD, it may be slow or failing. Consider upgrading to an SSD for significantly faster boot times.

- Malware or Viruses: Run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus program to check for any malicious software that could be slowing down your system.

- Updates: Ensure your operating system and drivers are up to date, as updates can sometimes fix performance issues.
